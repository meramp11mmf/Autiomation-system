Animation Loop with Python in Blender
# 🔄 Procedural Looping Animation in Blender (Python Script)

This project automates the creation of a seamless looping animation in Blender using Python and the `bpy` API. It showcases procedural geometry, materials, lighting, and camera setup — all generated and animated with code.

## 📽️ Features

- Clean scene setup
- Custom procedural ring objects with emissive and metallic shaders
- Floor with customizable color and material
- Automated lighting and camera placement
- Seamless rotation animation loop using keyframes
- Render settings automation (resolution, FPS, output path)

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Blender 3.x+
- Basic knowledge of running scripts in the Blender Scripting Editor

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open Blender.
2. Go to the "Scripting" workspace.
3. Paste the script from `main.py` into the editor.
4. Run the script.
5. The animation will be automatically created and ready to render.

## 🎞️ Output

The script generates a 3D looping animation of rotating rings with emissive and metallic materials under a dynamic lighting setup.

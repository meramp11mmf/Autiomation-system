# 🔄 Automation System – Procedural Animation with Blender & Python

<video src="media/preview.mp4" controls width="100%" style="border-radius: 8px;"></video>

This project automates the creation of a **seamless looping animation** in **Blender** using **Python** and the `bpy` API. It features procedural geometry, custom materials, lighting, camera setup, and animation — all generated and animated entirely through code.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎬 Clean scene initialization  
- 🌀 Procedural ring objects with **emissive and metallic shaders**  
- 🪩 Customizable floor with procedural material  
- 💡 Automated lighting and camera positioning  
- 🔁 Seamless rotation loop using keyframes  
- ⚙️ Automated render settings (resolution, FPS, output path)

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- **Blender 3.x+**
- Basic understanding of Python scripting in Blender

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open **Blender**.
2. Switch to the **Scripting** workspace.
3. Copy the code from `main.py` into the editor.
4. Click **Run Script**.
5. Your animation will be generated and ready to render!

![Preview](https://github.com/meramp11mmf/Autiomation-system/blob/main/Untitledvideo-MadewithClipchamp-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif)

This project automates the creation of a **seamless looping animation** in **Blender** using **Python** and the `bpy` API. It features procedural geometry, custom materials, lighting, camera setup, and animation â€” all generated and animated entirely through code.

## âœ¨ Features

Clean Scene Initialization: Start with a fresh scene by clearing all existing data.

 Procedural Ring Objects: Create rotating rings with custom emissive and metallic shaders for a dynamic, visually appealing effect.

 Customizable Floor: Generate a floor with procedural materials and colors that complement the animation.

 Automated Lighting & Camera Setup: Position and light the scene automatically for an optimal view.

 Seamless Animation Loop: Set up rotation animations with keyframes that create a smooth, continuous loop.

 Render Settings Automation: Automatically configure render settings, including resolution, FPS, and output path.
